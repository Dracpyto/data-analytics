Credit Card Cancellation Analysis
Project Overview
This mini project aims to analyze and uncover the reasons behind the credit card cancellation rates at Bank X. By utilizing Python and the pandas library, we will delve into the available data to identify key factors contributing to the cancellations. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can help Bank X reduce the cancellation rate and improve customer retention.

Data Analysis Process
Data Collection: Gather data related to customer demographics, transaction history, credit card usage patterns, customer service interactions, and any other relevant factors.
Data Cleaning: Use pandas to clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency across datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. This includes visualizing trends, identifying correlations, and summarizing key statistics.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might provide additional insights, such as average monthly spending, frequency of late payments, or customer tenure.
Modeling and Analysis: Apply statistical and machine learning models to identify patterns and predictors of credit card cancellations. Techniques might include logistic regression, decision trees, or clustering.
Interpretation and Reporting: Interpret the results to determine the main factors influencing credit card cancellations. Provide a detailed report with visualizations and recommendations for Bank X to address the identified issues.
